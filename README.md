# ChatRoom
A simple chat room

You should make sure your computer has already open mongodb-server first.

Then create 'users' in mongodb by 'db use users'.

Then use 'npm install'.

Finally use 'npm start' to start-up the JmmTalk in localhost:3000.

##If you want to chat with others you should change the URL in 20.talkRoom.html
